 |----- IE Support
 | lte IE8 ignores the media query blocks and runs the CSS rules as normal.
 |     To get lte IE8 to ignore media queries: use "only" in the rule OR use respond.js for IE 6-8 support OR use conditional comments
 |     Without the "only" keyword: lte IE8 will run the last set of CSS rules in a stylesheet regardless of whether they are in a media query block or not
